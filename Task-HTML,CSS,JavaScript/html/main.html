            <i>Understanding Banks</i><br>
            Banks have existed since at least the 14th century. They provide a safe place for consumers and business owners to stow their cash and a source of loans for personal purchases and business ventures. In turn, the banks use the cash that is deposited to make loans and collect interest on them.
            The basic business plan hasn't changed much since the Medici family started dabbling in banking during the Renaissance, but the range of products that banks offer has grown.<br>

            <i>Basic Bank Services</i><br>
            Banks offer various ways to stash your cash and various ways to borrow money.
